# Express debug toolbar

Most express.js servers run as backends for websites. Due to the quality of the browser development tools, there is little debug functionality for the web server.

This project aims to copy Pyramid's similar feature(which again is a derivative of something else, etc etc). It is made for a specific use case, but i hope someone else will find it useful.
